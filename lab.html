        <h3>Laboratory report n1</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Optical microscope observation of plant cells, respectively "Potato" and "Onion".
            Purpose of the experience :
            View and learn how to prepare a slide to be observed under the microscope, consequently learn how to use a microscope, its main elements and the application of the slide under the various objectives.     
            Operating procedure for slide preparation: <br>
            • Taking a sample from the subject to be observed; <br>
            • Position the latter on the slide, so that it adheres to the surface; <br>
            • If necessary, apply a small amount of water to the sample to make it adhere better to the base. • Then remove excess water; <br>
            • Place the observation slide on the sample <br>
            Remarks :
Once the slide preparation process is completed, it is positioned on the microscope observation base.
Potato analysis
By carrying out the analysis of the "Potato" first, it can be seen that the latter has several lumps or multiple agglomerates of starch, characterized by a grayish color and a fairly spherical shape.
Onion Skin Analysis
By moving the observation base, with the appropriate knobs (present in the right area of ​​the microscope), we can therefore move on to the analysis of the onion skin.
Initially we can see how the latter is presented in a totally different way from the previous plant, consisting of a base similar to a "consecution of bricks".
As far as the general vision is concerned, cells can be immediately noticed, with an irregular shape, also presented with a grayish coloration.

Final conclusions :
Today we have therefore analyzed two types of vegetables, which despite being of a similar "family", have totally different characteristics from each other.
We also learned how to properly prepare an observation slide, and how to place it under the microscope objectives.
And finally we analyzed the various components of the microscope that will come in handy in the future.
